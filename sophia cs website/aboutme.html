          <p>Hello, my name is Sophia Sun and I am a senior at Oakland Technical High School. I enjoy traveling, snowboarding, swimming, and hiking to view points! I plan to major in Computer Science when I attend college, so this was a very fun project to me where I can expand my knowledge on creating websites, along with different programming languages! </p>

  <h1 class= "display-1 text-center">Purpose</h1>

    <div class="row border">
      <div class="col-12 border">
         <p>The purpose of this website is to help peopel choose the right college for them. If they do not know which college they want to go to, they can play this quiz to figure out what fit their preferences.</p>
      </div>

      <h1 class= "display-1 text-center">Audience</h1>
      <div class="col-12 border">
        <p>The audience of this website is welcomed to anyone who does not know which college they want to go to. This can help with determining which college they want to go to. Main audience are high school teenagers because they are still figuring out where they want to go/what they want to do in the future.</p>
     </div>

      <h1 class= "display-1 text-center">Justification</h1>
      <div class="col-12 border">
        <p>Since the purpose of this website is to help people choose the right college for them, the message should be informative and easy to access. 
          Since the topic is very challenging to think about, the product should be an accessible source, so people can easily find out things about a certain UC. 
          Since the product (an informative source) is often boring and can be very long, this product should be relatively short and interesting to learn about (having fun questions). 
          Since the audience is high school teenagers/anyone who doesn't know which college they should go to, the product should have an exciting design that motivates others to decide on a college they want to go to.</p>
